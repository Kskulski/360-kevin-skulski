        <h4>About Me:</h4>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h4>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>React. It is incredibly popular and appears to be a good framework for entry level developers</li>
            <li>Azure Functions. They appear to be very useful. While I would like to learn to code my own back
                end server, Azure Functions are great for getting a project up and running quickly.
            </li>
            <li>Golang. Golang seems interesting and new languages are cool. I only know the basic 3 of Java, 
                Python, and C++ so I think it would be beneficial to have another tool in the belt.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>My Favorite Hobbies</h4>
        <p>Honestly, I have been trying to pick up more hobbies since highschool but as mentioned earlier 
            I had put all of my focus on school. My current hobbies are gaming, listening to music, and 
            reading. I have always thought about making a game but I know that is one heck of a rough 
            industry to get into but I still think I might try making something independently for fun. I 
            do my best to read real and decent literature but I am also in the process of collecting comics 
            for my favorite series. A couple of hobbies I would like to pick up after graduation would be 
            to get more exercise like biking or going to a gym. I also want to pick up a musical instrument 
            and give it go. I was thinking about bass in particular. Another hobby that I was into when I 
            was younger was 2D animation and I would like to get back into it. Also, I think I should practice 
            my coding more as a hobby because I always say I have trouble thinking of projects but I think that 
            the more I make, even if they are just tutorials, the more ideas I will have for functionality or 
            personal projects in the future.
        </p>
        <h4>Greatest Innovations</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>One of the greatest innovations in computer science is Margaret Hamilton and her team's code 
                for NASA's launch to the moon in 1969. It was a massive achievement especially considering the 
                ancient technology of the era. There is a famous picture of her next to a 6 foot tall stack of 
                punch cards containing the code.
            </li>
            <li>Linux is also a very important innovation in my opinion for computers because it is an open 
                source operating system. This is important as it helps to provide another option for people 
                who do not want to use Windows or Mac and have the know how of building the operating system 
                to match their particularneeds.
            </li>I saved the best innovation of them all for last. The Internet! While our current version of 
                the internet came much later in the 1990's from a computer scientist named Tim Berners-Lee, the 
                origin of the internet dates back to the 1970's. The first node to node computer network was 
                created in 1969 in fear from the U.S. of an attack on their telecommuncations system from the 
                Soviet Union. One node tried to send the word "Login" to the other node but only the first two 
                letters were received before the network crashed.

        <h4>Fun Fact!</h4>
        <p>I was watching a Discovery special about space with my dad and they were discussing the size 
            of the universe and its observable parts. At one point of the episode, they measured the distance 
            from the furthest observable galaxy to the us and found that the lightyears it took for the light 
            to reach Earth is actually greater than the amount of time we estimate the universe to have 
            existed. They go on to explain that this is because the universe is constantly expanding due to 
            an invisible factor to us named dark matter. However, it is not just expanding but stretching. 
            This concept is similar to stretching a rubber between your hands, one hand representing Earth 
            and the other representing the furthest observable galaxy. The light stretches and still reaches 
            us but the distance is expanded. Going back to dark matter for a second, the only way we can 
            observe dark matter is to create a complete vaccuum. Any changes to the material inside 
            (I think it was Helium?) must be caused from an external source which scientists believe is 
            dark matter permeating through the walls of the vaccuum.
